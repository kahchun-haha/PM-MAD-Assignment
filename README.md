# WIA2007 Mobile Application Development Group Assignment 2023/2024 ðŸ“±
This project is developed for the course Mobile Application Development. In this project, we had selected SDG 16 as our goal, and more specifically, in the context of domestic violence. Our app includes five main functional modules, which include emergency alarm, evidence capture, support helplines, education and risk assessment.

### Usage
Emergency Alarm - Users can add other registered users as their emergency contact, allowing live location sharing when emergency assistance is requested.

Evidence Capture - Users can take daily journal, and take photo which are then saved in Firebase. Photo are not lost when phone is lost or discovered by the abusers in the phone.

Support helplines - Users can search through a list of national helplines associated with domestic violence for support, and share experience on forum with other users.

Education - A dedicated education hub for domestic violence contents is provided for the users to gain more knowledge on the context.

Risk Assessment - A list of domestic violence related questions are prepared based on the CAADA-DASH framework developed by UK's MARAC, helping users to be more aware of their immediate situations.

### Tools and Language
Utilized Android Studio (Giraffe version), Java (JDK 17), XML, Firebase Realtime Database
